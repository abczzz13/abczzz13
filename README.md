# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Hey, I'm Thomas and I am a self-taught junior python developer. Here, you can find the projects I've been working on.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I have been mainly focussing my efforts on Python and the related frameworks Django and Flask. While also getting acquainted with professional workflows such as CI/CD, automated tests, version control and collaboration. However, I'm also open to learning new languages and techniques.
