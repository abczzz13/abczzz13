# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Hey, I'm Thomas and I am a self-taught junior python developer ðŸŒ±. Here, you can find the projects I've been working on.

ðŸŒ± I have started my journey with CS50x and I'm currently focusing my efforts on Python and the related frameworks Django and Flask. While also getting acquainted with professional workflows such as CI/CD, automated tests, version control and collaboration. But, I'm always open to learning new languages, skills and techniques.

Below you can find my work on the [FNDR app](https://github.com/abczzz13/fndr_backend), where I created the backend in Flask. If you would like to know more, feel free to explore this project.

My âœ¨ next project âœ¨ is going to make use of the Django framework, where I will be exploring the use of Celery, RabbitMQ, Docker and webhooks. More on this project soon!
